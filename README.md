​📝 Predictive Text Generator using RNN
​This repository features a Deep Learning model built to predict the next word or character in a sequence. Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), the model learns the statistical structure of the input text to generate human-like continuations.
​🚀 Overview
​The core of this project is a sequential model that processes text data by maintaining a "memory" of previous inputs. This allows it to understand context and predict what follows a given "seed" phrase.
​🧠 Model Architecture
​Input Layer: Text sequences converted into numerical tokens.
​RNN/LSTM Layer: The primary engine that captures long-term dependencies in the text.
​Dense Layer: A fully connected layer with a Softmax activation function to predict the probability of the next token.
​Optimization: Trained using Categorical Crossentropy and the Adam optimizer.
​🛠️ Tech Stack
​Language: Python
​Environment: Google Colab
​Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy
​📊 Results
​As seen in the training logs, the model achieves high accuracy (approx 1.0000 on training batches) and a low loss (approx 0.24), indicating it has successfully memorized and learned the patterns from the provided dataset.
​📂 How to Use
​Clone the repository.
​Open the .ipynb file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
​Run the cells to train or test the model with your own seed text.
